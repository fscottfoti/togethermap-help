They can be markers, lines, or free-form shapes.\n\n\nPosts are topics about that place.  Posts are the same thing that they are in web message boards like Reddit.  We're building place-based discussions with reddit-like functionality.\n\n\nAlso, comments are responses to posts.  You can click the \"read more\" link on each post in order to get to the actual comment threads.\n\n\nReally the use of places, posts, and comments is defined by your convention.  Some users don't use comments at all.  Some don't even use posts and just use TM to collect places and make maps.  It's really up to you to define a convention for a collection.\n\n\nCollections\n\n\nI hear the word collection mentioned a lot - what's that?\n\n\nCollections are a way to organize your places into groups which have a common theme.  A number of concepts are tied to collections including permissions, theming of how places appear both in the sidebar and on the map, and a few others things.  Collections are similar to a \"board\" in Pinterest or a \"layer\" in GIS.  \n\n\nThe key feature of TM is to store many collections in the same system and to be able to search across collections - for instance, to find all the places near you, no matter the collection they are a part of.  \n\n\nNonetheless, a great many use cases involve collecting place data within a single collection, and we will make sure to provide access to that functionality in the simplest way possible without complicating things with the greater scope of TM.\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nSo, what's the best way to get started?\n\n\nMy favorite use case is to collect places I want to remember - e.g. a set of coffee shops I might want to go to.  So let's assume you and a few friends want to build a collection of the best coffee shops for working in San Francisco.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst move the map to San Francisco (or to whever you are) using the \"location arrow\" in the upper left corner of the map.  It takes a second for your device to register the location (and you might have to accept permissions) but this moves the map to your location just like in Google Maps.\n\n\nYou might want to zoom out a bit (click minus twice) and you can click the \"location arrow\" again if you want the blue circle to go away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext make a new collection by clicking \"Go\" and \"New\".  This creates a new collection with the default name, which you can change to \"Fave Coffee\" or something similar.  You can also move the map around a bit to your preferred default view for this collection and click \"Set Default View\".  \nSet default view saves both the position and the background map you're currently using.\n\n\nClick \"Save\" to go the collection page for this collection.  In reality everything in TM is saved automatically and so \"save\" really just means \"back\" to the collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext click \"Go\" and then \"Search\".  By default TM searches the place database provided by Factual, Inc. in order to get a great starter set of \"places\" in the world.  Factual keeps a fairly up-to-date list of all the coffee shops, restaurants, parks, dentists, and so forth (over 65 million places worldwide).  Put \"coffee\" into the search box and TM begins to search automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow there's a set of places on the map that have all been returned from a Factual search.  Most are coffee shops, and all have some connection to coffee.  Click on one, possibly a nearby coffee shop that you know.  \n\n\nWhen you click on a place, TM will bring up the place detail page with additional information about the place, and a conversation thread to begin a discussion about the place.\n\n\nFor now click \"Copy to\".  A list of your collections comes up - both collections you created and collections you follow.  Click on \"Fave Coffee\" and the place gets added to the collection you created above.\n\n\nRepeat these steps for other coffee shops you want to add to your map.  It's all downhill from here.",

There's literally 100s of mapping apps out there, right?  Is this just another mapping app?\n\n\nGrab a Friend\n\n\nThe fun of TogetherMap is the collaborative spirit of mapping in real time.  We've all used Google Docs at this point - well, real time collaboration is quickly becoming a commodity on the internet thanks to tools like \nFirebase\n and \nMeteor\n.  We started out building on the first and settled on the second, because it's more flexible, open source, and an old friend of mine from high school is running the shop.\n\n\nDo you have that friend yet?  If you don't have that friend handy, you can open up a second browser, get your cell phone, or whatever.  The point is - when you add a place in TM, anyone else following that collection gets the update immediately (without a reload), and can respond with their own edits.  \n\n\nThis is true almost everywhere in TM.  Posts are made in real time on places (like a chatroom), collection lists are refreshed on-the-fly, and even users accepting permissions are updated instantly.  Grab 100s of friends if you can, and watch the map come to life.  \n\n\nAnd there's no fake maps in TM.  Everything on the site exists in the world out there too, so use TM to help discover new things about the city you live in!  This is not Facebook - helping you keep up with friends 1000s of miles away.  This is TogetherMap, helping you find new experiences in the world you walk through every day.\n\n\nPlace-based Posting\n\n\nA big part of that is place-based posting.  It's a pretty simple addition to an idea that's everywhere on the web.  Basically you have a conversation thread tied to each and every place you make.  Start a new topic or comment as a response to a previous topic.  \n\n\nEvery place is assigned to a single collection (although places can be copied to other collections and even modified).  In this way multiple discussions can occur about each place. Discussions for each place only happen within the current collection, but there will be links to the other collections a place occurs in for eavesdropping into other groups' conversations (look for \"Collections this place is a member of\" on each place).  If a collection is private, all conversations in that collection are private.  \n\n\nSo for example a place might be in one collection of \"breakfast joints\" and also a second of \"bars\" and you can imagine the conversation that occurs in each collection might be very different.\n\n\nSifting through the Noise\n\n\nLike any multi-user website, if the community is active enough, there need to be ways to find the signal through the noise.  TM typically subscribes to the same philosophy as Reddit here, using up- and down-votes, and to some degree clicks, as well as a free text search and browse of collections.  At this time, the voting system is present for collections and places, and will be added to posts when it's needed.  Search now applies to places but can also be added to collections and posts.\n\n\nBut like Pinterest, TM uses you the user to curate collections of places and to sift through the noise.

You must be logged to create or edit content on TM so we can associate your data with your account, which is true of any online service.  If you're logged in to a private collection, your data is as secure as your online bank.\n\n\nThe Map View\n\n\nThe map view has a few small widgets which control the map pane.  Along the right hand side is the \"sidebar\" which fills with content depending on your most recently performed action.  In the upper right hand corner is the layer switcher, which lets you change basemaps (e.g. to aerial photographs and a few others).  Most of the basemaps use data from \nOpenStreetMap\n.\n\n\nAlong the left hand side are the zoom in and zoom out buttons, the share widget, the geocoding widget and the location widget.  In reverse order, the location widget takes you to where you are in the world, the geocoder lets you put in an address and when you select a matching address takes you to that location, and the share widget lets you share on social media, and importantly, gives you the html snippet to embed a TogetherMap on your website.\n\n\nEmbedding\n\n\nLet's give that a header.  The share widget contains the html snippet to embed a TogetherMap on your website.  Please do!\n\n\nCollection Page\n\n\nNavigation typically happens by clicking on a collection, either in the \"Mine\" list, the \"Followed\" list, or via the \"Browse\" link.  When a collection is clicked, you get up to 100 places in the map view for that collection, and the sidebar contains a description of the collection.  If there are more than 100 places in the map view where you are, you might need to zoom in to load more places.  TM will let you know if you're looking at all possible places with the statement \"All places in visible area are available.\"  \n\n\nIf you click the button for \"Recent\" you will get the most recent places, posts and comments for the collection.  You may also up or down vote the collection here.  If you have \"owner\" permissions on the collection, you will be able to edit the collection configuration and set the permissions, which will be explained in the \ncustomization\n and \npermissions\n pages respectively.  \n\n\nIf you do \nnot\n own the collection, you will have the option to follow the collection, and if you are already following the collection you will have the option to unfollow the collection.  \n\n\nThe collection page also includes a scrollable list of all the places currently loaded for the collection.  Whenever you mouse over the \"card\" for a place, if the place is a marker it will bounce to show you which place this \"card\" represents on the map.  You can also click the location arrow in the upper right hand corner to pan to the place, and click again to zoom in on the place.\n\n\nPlace and Post Pages\n\n\nClick on a place, either in the map view or in the place list in the collection view, and you will arrive on the place page.  The place page mainly is to provide the place (pun intended) to have a conversation about the place.  \n\n\nBelow the place description is a list of current posts about this place.  Create a new topic or respond by commenting on another topic.  To comment click on the \"Read More\" button to arrive at the post page, or click \"Post New Topic\" to - you guessed it - post a new topic.\n\n\nFrom this page you can also vote the place up or down, copy it to another collection, or edit the place properties, including marker icon, color, and size (small, medium, and large).\n\n\nAdding Places\n\n\nIf you have place adding permissions for a given collection (which you always have if you created or own the collection), then you will see a toolbar at the bottom left hand corner of the map.  From the bottom, the icons are for delete, edit, marker add, polygon add, and line add.  The last 3 add the main 3 kinds of shapes in any spatial information system and TM is no expection.\n\n\nTM uses the wonderful library \nLeaflet\n as it's mapping library, and this drawing toolbar is the \nLeaflet Draw\n widget.  A pretty great blog to understand the breadth of this plugin is provided \nhere\n.\n\n\nBut we think its use is pretty simple.  The shape creation buttons use tooltips to show how to use them.  As a quick reminder, click the last point twice to finish drawing a line, and click the first point a second time to close a polygon.\n\n\nIf you click the edit button, you now enter a mode where you can drag any marker on the map to a new location, which is always fun but use wisely.  The delete button allows you to remove places from the map with a click.  The should \ndefinitely\n be used wisely.  Places can also be deleted by clicking the edit button on the place page and then the delete button.  As a reminder, only owners of the collection or the creators of each place will have the permissions to delete each place.\n\n\nAdding Places Redux\n\n\nThere are two other super easy ways to add places.  If you're on the desktop, just right click and use the context menu to add a place.  Or you can click on \"Go\" and \"Settings\" (or just Ctrl-d) to turn double clicking into marker adding (as opposed to its default function, which is to zoom in).",

A pretty great blog to understand the breadth of this plugin is provided  here .  But we think its use is pretty simple.  The shape creation buttons use tooltips to show how to use them.  As a quick reminder, click the last point twice to finish drawing a line, and click the first point a second time to close a polygon.  If you click the edit button, you now enter a mode where you can drag any marker on the map to a new location, which is always fun but use wisely.  The delete button allows you to remove places from the map with a click.  The should  definitely  be used wisely.  Places can also be deleted by clicking the edit button on the place page and then the delete button.  As a reminder, only owners of the collection or the creators of each place will have the permissions to delete each place.",

This will likely be configurable in the interface in the future, but programming is the only completely general solution that takes advantage of some wonderful open source tools that have been made available on the web.  As you will soon see, the basics can be done with no previous programming knowledge, and with only the basics you can do some very powerful things in TM.\n\n\nShapefiles\n\n\nShapefiles are the lifeblood of GIS.  Although TM isn't GIS, we can start with shapefiles because shapefiles are the most common way to 1) define a shape and 2) associate attributes with a shape.  That's good because we \nwill\n want to associate attribtues with a shape.  In our example, let's say we have a set of shapes, each of which has a name, description, and image url.\n\n\nJSON\n\n\nInstead of shapefiles, the vernacular of the web is JSON.  JSON is essentially a Javascript object which is a key value dictionary that is human readable.  For our example, you need only deal with one object at a time.  TogetherMap takes care of reading the places from the database, synchronizing updates between users and many other things.  Here is a sample place.\n\n\n{\n    shape: [-37.7792, 122.4191],\n    name: \nSan Francisco City Hall\n,\n    description: \nThis is the City Hall of SF\n,\n    image_url: \nhttp://imgur.com/ABCD\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nGeoJSON\n\n\nOK, that's easy enough, but what about the shape arribute?  In fact, there is a whole specification for representing shapes in JSON called \nGeoJSON\n and this is the preferred way to represent shapes on the web rather than shapefiles.  TM uses GeoJSON.  In practive, you will never, ever have to know how shapes are stored.  TM does this for you.  You only need to know how to turn the attributes into text or into marker themes.\n\n\nJSON in TM\n\n\nLet's imagine a coworker sent you a shapefile and you imported it into TM.  You don't even really know what attributes are in the shapefile.  Worry not.  Once the data is in TM, that is now our problem.  Under the first text area is a button with the text \"JSON\" on it.  Click it and it will give you a formatted sample object from this collection.  I will print one below so you're not too worried when you see a place with it's full complexity.  \n\n\nSo what do you need to know about this?  Not as much as you'd think.  The magic is all in the \"properties\" sub-dictionary, and you will see \"properties\" come up a lot in TM templates.  \"properties\" is part of the GeoJSON spec and allows us to conform with existing conventions - this is where all of the attributes go.  There are also some higher level attributes which TM adds, like createDate, updateDate, and creator which might be of some use, but for the most part, everything you need is under \"properties\".  \n\n\nHere you see name, image_url, and we'll use \"caption\" instead of \"description.\"  Note that the \"name\" attribute on the place is what gets filled in the text box when you edit a place, and the \"description\" is filled in by the text editor.  The other attributes you can edit when on the place edit page are \"icon\", \"icon_size\", and \"color\".  Note that these correspond to the 5 html form elements that you see on every place edit page.\n\n\n{\n  \n_id\n: \n7yqXaYKi3ZbaLCemM\n,\n  \ngeometry\n: {\n    \ntype\n: \nPoint\n,\n    \ncoordinates\n: [\n      -122.429913,\n      37.766286\n    ]\n  },\n  \ntype\n: \nFeature\n,\n  \nbbox\n: {\n    \ntype\n: \nPoint\n,\n    \ncoordinates\n: [\n      -122.429913,\n      37.766286\n    ]\n  },\n  \nproperties\n: {\n    \ndescription\n: \n,\n    \ncolor\n: \n#63d7b2\n,\n    \nname\n: \n2175 Market\n,\n    \ncaption\n: \nFormerly a 76 gas station, 2175 Market will bring new housing units to transit-heavy Market Street.

Your web browser visualizes only HTML but JSON is the data which \"backs\" the HTML.  For instance, we'll want to format and display the name as a header, the description as normal text, and the image_url as an image.  You can see the actual collection we're trying to create \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe first template that we can configure is the \"Place Template (for Place Detail)\".  This is the template that is used on the place page.  The actual template for the collection above is shown here.  Here we're substituting in the name, url, image_url, and caption properties into a small html snippet.\n\n\nThe name is rendered as header, the url as a link, caption as normal text, and the image url as an image.  It's pretty much that simple.  Note that the double curly braces mean to substitute that attribute as text and the triple curly braces mean that attribute is \nalready\n html and should be rendered as html.\n\n\nKeep in mind that each template has a \"test\" button that allows you to test the template on a randomly chosen place to see what it looks like.\n\n\nh2\n{{properties.name}}\n/h2\n\n\n{{#if properties.url}}\n\na href=\n{{properties.url}}\n target=\n_blank\nView on Curbed\n/a\n\n\nbr\nbr\n\n{{/if}}\n\n{{{properties.caption}}}\n\n\nbr\nbr\n\n\n\nimg src=\n{{properties.image_url}}\n style=\nwidth: 100%;\n\n\nbr\nbr\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's really all you need to know to make a nicely formatted page, and a place page created by this template is shown below.  If you're an intermediate to advanced web programmer, you should know that these templates are rendered with \nhandlebarsjs\n which is a very powerful templating library, and everything it can do TM can do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe user also controls the template for the \"Place List\" which is the list of places below the collection description, and the one for our sample collection looks like this:\n\n\nh4\n{{properties.name}}\n/h4\n\n\n{{#if properties.url}}\n\na href=\n{{properties.url}}\n target=\n_blank\nView on Curbed\n/a\n\n\nbr\nbr\n\n{{/if}}\n\n{{{properties.caption}}}\n\n\nbr\nbr\n\n\n\nimg src=\n{{properties.image_url}}\n style=\nwidth: 300px;\n\n\nbr\nbr\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is almost the same template as the place detail template except that the name is rendered with a small header (h4 instead of h2) and the image is not as wide to make scrolling easier.\n\n\nThe final template is for the label that pops up when you mouse over a place.  The one for our sample collection looks like this:\n\n\nh4\n{{properties.name}}\n/h4\n\n\nimg src=\n{{properties.image_url}}\n style=\nwidth: 100px;\n\n\nbr\n\n\n\n\n\nShort and sweet.  The popup doesn't have much room, so we display the name and a thumbnail version of the image.  That's it, there's nothing more to it.\n\n\nAutoform\n\n\nNow let's assume your friend didn't send you a shapefile that had shapes and attributes and you need to create that information directly in TM.  We already know how to make the shapes from the discussion on \nAdding Places\n.  What's new in this section is how your users can easily enter attributes on TM, which we do this using HTML forms. \n\n\nTM does this in a spcial way which uses the \nAutoform\n package from the Meteor framework.  Using this package you no longer have to painstakingly write the HTML by hand, you just configure the form with a JSON spec and TM will take care of rendering the form.  \n\n\nFor instance, let's say you want to record the number of residential units (a number), the number of non-residential square feet (another number), and a drop down for \"has bike parking\" which can take the values of yes, no, and maybe.  No problem.  The code to create that form is shown below, which includes some extra formatting information for how to label each element in the form, and to make sure we don't allow negative numbers for the counts we want to record.  \n\n\nThere's actually quite a bit more configuration that can be done with autoform, and we suggest you go directly to the \nautoform playground\n to build your form on their website.  You can then copy the JSON back to the text area on TM and we will add a form on \nthe edit page\n of every place to collect attributes about that place.  These attributes can then be rendered in the HTML templates described above, or the themes described below, or even exported into a shapefile for further analysis outside of TM.\n\n\n{\n  residentialUnits: {\n    label: \nNumber of residential units in development:\n,\n    type: Number,\n    min: 0\n  },\n  nonResidentialSqft: {\n    label: \nNumber of non-res square footage:\n,\n    type: Number,\n    min: 0\n  },\n  hasBikeParking: {\n    type: String,\n    label: \nHas bike parking:\n,\n    allowedValues: [\n       \nYes\n, \nNo\n, \nDon't know\n\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n...which creates the form that looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n...and can be seen in action on \nthis\n collection.\n\n\nTheming Functions\n\n\nNow let's say your friend sent you a shapefile with some numbers already entered (probably the old way, using some desktop GIS tool), and these numbers represent new buildings in San Francisco.  The buildings can be office buildings, residential buildings, and can vary in size from just a few townhomes to hundreds and hundreds of upscale condos.  \n\n\nIn fact, with web maps we can change the size of markers, the colors, and the icons, and our goal is to make each building show up on a web map as a marker with a certain \"theme\" - in other words, we want to map certain attributes in the shapefile to certain traits of the markers.  \n\n\nWe do that in TM with \"theming functions\" which are next in the collection edit page.  There is a theming function for the icon (the picture that's inside the marker), the marker size, and the color for the marker (click the buttons above the text area to specify each function).  Theming functions are actual Javascript functions so are the only thing that's actual code in TM.  Still, Javascript is a pretty easy language to use so it shouldn't be too challenging to get through the basics.\n\n\nAs an example, we're trying to build the theme shown in the screenshot below.  This is available as a live demo \nhere\n.  This data is the actual development pipeline provided by the San Francisco Planning Department for late 2012 and early 2013.\n\n\n\n\nFirst we specify the icon.  TM uses the Maki icons which are described (and can be searched) \nhere\n.  All you have to do to specify the icon is to return the name of one of the icons that's shown at the link above.  In this example, we want to to use the icon for \"building\" when there are residential units and \"commercial\" when there are not.\n\n\nTo do this we use the ternary (question mark) operator in Javascript.  Note that in our functions the variable \"p\" is set to the \"properties\" dictionary we discussed above (the one that contains the attributes we always care about).  What this code says is that if the attribute \"Units\" is greater than zero, return the string \"building\", otherwise return \"commercial\", and TM takes care of the rest for you.\n\n\nTwo things to remember since this is Javascript.  First, it's very easy to create errors because this is relatively free-form coding, and second, you can open the console in the Chrome browser to see those errors and get a hint as to what you might be doing wrong.  Since this is coding, you won't get it right the first time and will have to hone in on the desired behavior by trial and error.  We promise we will make this easier in the future, but until then I feel confident you can do it!\n\n\nRemember that you have to refresh the page in order to re-render the markers, so every change you make in the theming functions you will need to refresh to see the results.\n\n\nreturn p.Units \n 0 ? \nbuilding\n : \ncommercial\n;\n\n\n\n\nNext comes icon size.  This function must return one of the strings 's', 'm', and 'l' for small, medium, and large markers respectively.  Yep, that's all there is to it.  The function below returns 'l' when Units is greater than 80 or when the TotalSqftEstim attribute is greater than 150k.  I think this code should be fairly easy to understand once you understand that \"||\" means \"or\" in Javascript.\n\n\nif(p.Units \n 80 || p.TotalSqftEstim \n 150000) return 'l';\nif(p.Units \n 30 || p.TotalSqftEstim \n 25000) return 'm';\nreturn 's';\n\n\n\n\nNext is the icon color function.  This is very similar to the others but returns a color value.  These colors can be hex numbers - you can search Google for a hex \"color picker\" and use your favorite from the web and just copy the value in here.  It can also return simple colors like \"blue\", \"red\", \"yellow\", etc, but these colors are less nuanced obviously.\n\n\nThis function says, first check if there are no residential units, if so return a blue color.  After that we know that the building is residential, but if it \nalso\n contains commercial (the next line), we return purple.  Then if it's a \nlarge\n building return red and otherwise return yellow.  And that's how we choose the colors you see in the image above.\n\n\nThe one thing worth noting on this example is that you can use the \np.Units\n notation if the attribute doesn't have weird characters in it, but you have to use \np['WHATEVER']\n notation if it does, which is why we have to do \np['Total GSF (Commercial)']\n.  Otherwise you should have seen all this before.\n\n\nif(!p.Units) return '544FDB';\nif(p['Total GSF (Commercial)'] \n 500) return '9D28E0';\nreturn p.Units \n 120 ? 'E02850' : 'E0DD28';\n\n\n\n\nThat's pretty much it.  With the above configuration, you can do pretty much anything in TM - you can record information from your users, you can use that data to theme the map, and you can use the same data to make html templates in the place detail view, the place list view, and the labels.  Please feel free to ask questions - we'd love to help!\n\n\nDrop Markers\n\n\nThere are a few other on/off attributes in the collection edit view that will be discussed briefly here.  \"Drop markers\" can be turned on for an effect that drops the markers from the sky in animated fashion whenever markers are added to the map.  This is a question of taste though, so is user configuratble.\n\n\nTurning off the Geoindex\n\n\nThe \"geoindex\" can also be turned on and off.  The geoindex is the functionality that limits the places that are loaded to only those shown in the map view.  If you had hundreds of thousands of city markers worldwide, you would just want to load the few cities that are in the map view, so this is turned on by default.  If you have less than a hundred places or so, it's usually fine to turn this off, which loads all the places in the collection immediately and can be handy for subsequent responsiveness and also so that all the places are in the list view all the time which is perhaps easier for users to understand on small collections.  At any rate, it's up to the collection owner how they choose to set this.",

As a word of warning, a modest amount of programming is requried to customize the templates in TogetherMap.

I will print one below so you're not too worried when you see a place with it's full complexity.    So what do you need to know about this?  Not as much as you'd think.  The magic is all in the \"properties\" sub-dictionary, and you will see \"properties\" come up a lot in TM templates.  \"properties\" is part of the GeoJSON spec and allows us to conform with existing conventions - this is where all of the attributes go.  There are also some higher level attributes which TM adds, like createDate, updateDate, and creator which might be of some use, but for the most part, everything you need is under \"properties\".    Here you see name, image_url, and we'll use \"caption\" instead of \"description.\"  Note that the \"name\" attribute on the place is what gets filled in the text box when you edit a place, and the \"description\" is filled in by the text editor.  The other attributes you can edit when on the place edit page are \"icon\", \"icon_size\", and \"color\".

The first template that we can configure is the \"Place Template (for Place Detail)\".  This is the template that is used on the place page.  The actual template for the collection above is shown here.  Here we're substituting in the name, url, image_url, and caption properties into a small html snippet.  The name is rendered as header, the url as a link, caption as normal text, and the image url as an image.  It's pretty much that simple.  Note that the double curly braces mean to substitute that attribute as text and the triple curly braces mean that attribute is  already  html and should be rendered as html.  Keep in mind that each template has a \"test\" button that allows you to test the template on a randomly chosen place to see what it looks like.  h2 {{properties.name}} /h2 \n\n{{#if properties.url}} a href= {{properties.url}}  target= _blank View on Curbed /a  br br \n{{/if}}\n\n{{{properties.caption}}} br br  img src= {{properties.image_url}}  style= width: 100%;  br br   That's really all you need to know to make a nicely formatted page, and a place page created by this template is shown below.  If you're an intermediate to advanced web programmer, you should know that these templates are rendered with  handlebarsjs  which is a very powerful templating library, and everything it can do TM can do.     \nThe user also controls the template for the \"Place List\" which is the list of places below the collection description, and the one for our sample collection looks like this:  h4 {{properties.name}} /h4 \n\n{{#if properties.url}} a href= {{properties.url}}  target= _blank View on Curbed /a  br br \n{{/if}}\n\n{{{properties.caption}}} br br  img src= {{properties.image_url}}  style= width: 300px;  br br   This is almost the same template as the place detail template except that the name is rendered with a small header (h4 instead of h2) and the image is not as wide to make scrolling easier.  The final template is for the label that pops up when you mouse over a place.  The one for our sample collection looks like this:  h4 {{properties.name}} /h4  img src= {{properties.image_url}}  style= width: 100px;  br   Short and sweet.

We already know how to make the shapes from the discussion on  Adding Places .  What's new in this section is how your users can easily enter attributes on TM, which we do this using HTML forms.   TM does this in a spcial way which uses the  Autoform  package from the Meteor framework.  Using this package you no longer have to painstakingly write the HTML by hand, you just configure the form with a JSON spec and TM will take care of rendering the form.    For instance, let's say you want to record the number of residential units (a number), the number of non-residential square feet (another number), and a drop down for \"has bike parking\" which can take the values of yes, no, and maybe.  No problem.
