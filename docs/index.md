# Make maps of things, then talk about them.

## The Name

*What does TM mean?*

TM is shorthand for TogetherMap.  With TM you can make maps collaboratively.

## Mission

*What is the purpose of TM?*

Generally, our mission is to provide an app for people to talk about what's happening in their communities.  Along the way we realized we were building a pretty useful multi-user environment for place collecting, map making, and data collection, so we're going to try out a few things and see what sticks.  Example use cases are up next.

## Examples

* Loading scraped web data of recent condo developments in San Francisco and talking about them.

* Building a list of your favorite nearby places for friends that are visiting from out of town.

* Adding pictures of places to photo blog your travels.

* Collecting data about places using web forms.
