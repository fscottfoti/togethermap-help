## Search

When the user clicks on "Go" and "Search", a search will be performed for places in the map view.  By default, the Factual place database - a database of 65 million coffee shops, restaurants and other points of interest - is searched the first time the user clicks on "Search".  If the toggle is then pressed, the search will be performed for places in TogetherMap rather than Factual, and the toggle will indicate which data is being searched.

For either search, only about 25 places will be returned even if there are 1000s of available places in the map view.  Either zoom in to limit the geographic scope, or enter a query in the search box.  As you type characters the search results will be updated automatically in both the map view and list view.

## Settings

The only current setting is the meaning of double click mentioned in the [Adding Places Redux](basics.md), which can be used to switch from "zoom in" to "place addition" and back.

Soon many additional settings will be added, including at least the ability to configure email notifications on a collection-by-collection basis.

## Email updates

At this time, email updates are sent as nightly digest emails.  An email will arrive in your inbox each morning with the 10 most recent places, posts, and comments which occurred on any of the collections you own or follow.

If no updates were made in the previous 24 hours on your collections, no email will be sent.  In this way, emails are used to alert the user that there was recent activity for collections which have relatively infrequent activity.
