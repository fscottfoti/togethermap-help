## Search

When the user clicks the "Hamburger" and "Search", a search will be performed for places in the map view.  By default, the Factual place database - a database of 65 million coffee shops, restaurants and other points of interest - is searched the first time the user clicks on "Search".  If the radio button is switched to TogetherMap, data from TM that the user has permissions to view will be searchable.

## Settings

One current setting is the meaning of double click mentioned in the [Adding Places Redux](basics.md), which can be used to switch from "zoom in" to "place addition" and back.

You can also switch the "pan to place" settings which when enabled will pan to each place as you hover the mouse over the "card" in the Collection page.  Normally the place will be highlighted, but this enables you to quickly pan to the place if it's not shown in the current map view.

Soon many additional settings will be added, including at least the ability to configure email notifications on a collection-by-collection basis.

## Email updates

At this time, email updates are sent as nightly digest emails.  An email will arrive in your inbox each morning with the 10 most recent places and comments which occurred on each of the collections you own or follow.

If no updates were made in the previous 24 hours on your collections, no email will be sent.  In this way, emails are used to alert the user that there was recent activity for collections which have relatively infrequent activity.
