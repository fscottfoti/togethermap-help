## The Text Editors

You'll notice that there are small text editors that are used to enter a description of the collections and places, as well as to enter new topics and comments.  These text editors are configurable and provided to us by [Froala](froala.com).  By default these text editors let you bold and italicize the text, make bulleted lists, create links, and embed video and images.  

The far right icon lets you switch to "code" view so you can edit the actual HTML.  Although it's not common, sometimes a `<br>` tag to make a proper line break can save a lot of embarassment.

## Images

If Pinterest has taught us anything, it's that images are the lifeblood of the web, and TogetherMap is no exception.  We highly reccommend adding images wherever possible in TM to liven things up a bit, but this is entirely up to the user.  

The easiest way to add images to TM is by clicking the image embed icon in every text editor.  In this way you can add images to any collection, place, post, or comment.  In the near future we will add functionality to create entire photo collections based on importing data from Flickr, Instagram, and Picasa.

## Images from Social

For now, click on the image icon second to right in any text editor.  This will open up the image selection dialog that is provided to us by [filepicker.com](https://www.filepicker.com/).  This part should be fairly easy to figure out, but note that filepicker connects you to your account for Box, Dropbox, Facebook, Google Drive, Flickr, Instagram, and Picasa all within this easy-to-use interface.  

Note that this does *not* give us access to your accounts, you simply choose which content you want to move to TM so that you can organize and view it on a map.  

## Other Image Sources

**Not to be underestimated is the "web images" option which allows you to quickly do a web search for images and find a picture of a place to add to TM.**  

If you already know of an image on the web (or prefer using the Google image search), you can use the "link" option.  

**Also keep in mind that if you go to to TM on mobile, you can use filepicker to upload directly from your phone's camera, which is by far the easiest option available for map based travel diaries.**
