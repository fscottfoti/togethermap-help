## Images

If Pinterest has taught us anything, it's that images are the lifeblood of the web, and TogetherMap has several bits of functionality to make assocating images with places and collections fairly easy.  We highly reccommend adding images wherever possible in TM to liven things up a bit, but this depends on the use case.  

The easiest way to add images to TM is by clicking the image button on every collection edit or place edit page.  When you click this button, this will open up the image selection dialog that is provided to us by [filepicker.com](https://www.filepicker.com/).  This part should be fairly easy to figure out, but note that filepicker connects you to your account for Box, Dropbox, Facebook, Google Drive, Flickr, Instagram, and Picasa all within this easy-to-use interface.  

Note that this does *not* give us access to your accounts, you simply choose which content you want to move to TM so that you can organize and view it on a map.

## Other Image Sources

**Not to be underestimated is the "web images" option which allows you to quickly do a web search for images and find a picture of a place to add to TM.**

If you already know of an image on the web (or prefer using the Google image search), you can use the "link" option.  

**Also keep in mind that if you go to to TM on mobile, you can use filepicker to upload directly from your phone's camera, which is by far the easiest option available for map based travel diaries.**
