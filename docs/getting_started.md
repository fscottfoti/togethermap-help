## Places and Posts

*I see places and posts mentioned a lot - what are those?*

Places are shapes on the map.  They can be markers, lines, or free-form shapes.

Posts are topics about that place.  Posts are the same thing that they are in web message boards like Reddit.  We're building place-based discussions with reddit-like functionality.

Also, comments are responses to posts.  You can click the "read more" link on each post in order to get to the actual comment threads.

Really the use of places, posts, and comments is defined by your convention.  Some users don't use comments at all.  Some don't even use posts and just use TM to collect places and make maps.  It's really up to you to define a convention for a collection.

## Collections

*I hear the word collection mentioned a lot - what's that?*

Collections are a way to organize your places into groups which have a common theme.  A number of concepts are tied to collections including permissions, theming of how places appear both in the sidebar and on the map, and a few others things.  Collections are similar to a "board" in Pinterest or a "layer" in GIS.  

The key feature of TM is to store many collections in the same system and to be able to search across collections - for instance, to find all the places near you, no matter the collection they are a part of.  

Nonetheless, a great many use cases involve collecting place data within a single collection, and we will make sure to provide access to that functionality in the simplest way possible without complicating things with the greater scope of TM.

## Getting Started

*So, what's the best way to get started?*

My favorite use case is to collect places I want to remember - e.g. a set of coffee shops I might want to go to.  So let's assume you and a few friends want to build a collection of the best coffee shops for working in San Francisco.

* First move the map to San Francisco (or to whever you are) using the "location arrow" in the upper left corner of the map.  It takes a second for your device to register the location (and you might have to accept permissions) but this moves the map to your location just like in Google Maps.

	You might want to zoom out a bit (click minus twice) and you can click the "location arrow" again if you want the blue circle to go away.

* Next make a new collection by clicking "Go" and "New".  This creates a new collection with the default name, which you can change to "Fave Coffee" or something similar.  You can also move the map around a bit to your preferred default view for this collection and click "Set Default View".  **Set default view saves both the position and the background map you're currently using.**
	
	Click "Save" to go the collection page for this collection.  In reality everything in TM is saved automatically and so "save" really just means "back" to the collection.

* Next click "Go" and then "Search".  By default TM searches the place database provided by Factual, Inc. in order to get a great starter set of "places" in the world.  Factual keeps a fairly up-to-date list of all the coffee shops, restaurants, parks, dentists, and so forth (over 65 million places worldwide).  Put "coffee" into the search box and TM begins to search automatically.

* Now there's a set of places on the map that have all been returned from a Factual search.  Most are coffee shops, and all have some connection to coffee.  Click on one, possibly a nearby coffee shop that you know.  

	When you click on a place, TM will bring up the place detail page with additional information about the place, and a conversation thread to begin a discussion about the place.

	For now click "Copy to".  A list of your collections comes up - both collections you created and collections you follow.  Click on "Fave Coffee" and the place gets added to the collection you created above.

	Repeat these steps for other coffee shops you want to add to your map.  It's all downhill from here.
