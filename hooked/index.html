<p>OK, if you're following along you will have a collection with a few coffee shops added at this point.  Nice work.  But what's the big deal about TogetherMap?  There's literally 100s of mapping apps out there, right?  Is this just another mapping app?</p>
<h2 id="grab-a-friend">Grab a Friend</h2>
<p>The fun of TogetherMap is the collaborative spirit of mapping in real time.  We've all used Google Docs at this point - well, real time collaboration is quickly becoming a commodity on the internet thanks to tools like <a href="http://www.firebase.com">Firebase</a> and <a href="http://www.meteor.com">Meteor</a>.  We started out building on the first and settled on the second, because it's more flexible, open source, and an old friend of mine from high school is running the shop.</p>
<p>Do you have that friend yet?  If you don't have that friend handy, you can open up a second browser, get your cell phone, or whatever.  The point is - when you add a place in TM, anyone else following that collection gets the update immediately (without a reload), and can respond with their own edits.  </p>
<p>This is true almost everywhere in TM.  Posts are made in real time on places (like a chatroom), collection lists are refreshed on-the-fly, and even users accepting permissions are updated instantly.  Grab 100s of friends if you can, and watch the map come to life.  </p>
<p>And there's no fake maps in TM.  Everything on the site exists in the world out there too, so use TM to help discover new things about the city you live in!  This is not Facebook - helping you keep up with friends 1000s of miles away.  This is TogetherMap, helping you find new experiences in the world you walk through every day.</p>
<h2 id="place-based-posting">Place-based Posting</h2>
<p>A big part of that is place-based posting.  It's a pretty simple addition to an idea that's everywhere on the web.  Basically you have a conversation thread tied to each and every place you make.  Start a new topic or comment as a response to a previous topic.  </p>
<p>Every place is assigned to a single collection (although places can be copied to other collections and even modified).  In this way multiple discussions can occur about each place. Discussions for each place only happen within the current collection, but there will be links to the other collections a place occurs in for eavesdropping into other groups' conversations (look for "Collections this place is a member of" on each place).  If a collection is private, all conversations in that collection are private.  </p>
<p>So for example a place might be in one collection of "breakfast joints" and also a second of "bars" and you can imagine the conversation that occurs in each collection might be very different.</p>
<h2 id="sifting-through-the-noise">Sifting through the Noise</h2>
<p>Like any multi-user website, if the community is active enough, there need to be ways to find the signal through the noise.  TM typically subscribes to the same philosophy as Reddit here, using up- and down-votes, and to some degree clicks, as well as a free text search and browse of collections.  At this time, the voting system is present for collections and places, and will be added to posts when it's needed.  Search now applies to places but can also be added to collections and posts.</p>
<p>But like Pinterest, TM uses you the user to curate collections of places and to sift through the noise.  Find the best collections and follow them.  Find the best collectors and look through their other collections.  Who knows what you might find?  As TM grows, we will highlight the best collectors and the best collections and make sure the world knows about them.</p></div>
